# data-analysis

Initial repo for Github training purposes

I had not committed to fully learning about how to properly use Github, so I am using several files from a data analysis tutorial to manipulate using Git locally on Linux Mint. I had to force push the first commit, which I understand is possibly dangerous, so I am hoping I can find the more legit way of doing it in the future. (SWS~04.05.17)
